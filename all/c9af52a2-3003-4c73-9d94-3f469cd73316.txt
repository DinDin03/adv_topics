EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Temporomandibular Joints 



Procedure(s): XRTMJ - XR Temporomandibular Joints 



XRMAND - XR Mandible 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Juvenile arthritis - jaw pain and bony ? lump on mandible right chin. 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



A small benign bony prominence can be seen arising from the inferior aspect of the parasymphyseal right mandible.  It almost resembles a small exostosis, but this would not be a common location.  I suspect the finding is representative of anatomical variation.  The mandible elsewhere is of normal appearance.  The temporomandibular joints show no evidence of erosive arthropathy.  Each appears to demonstrate physiological dislocation, in a symmetrical fashion.
