EXAMINATION: 



XRELBRI - XR Elbow Right 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Sore right elbow.  Posterior fat pad sign.  No fracture seen. 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



There is an elbow joint effusion with displacement of fat pads and soft tissue swelling.  There is a destructive lesion in the distal right humeral metaphysis centrally with irregular margins extending through the distal humeral cortex into the growth plate.  There is an ill-defined ossific fragment within the area of bone destruction.  There is also a submetaphyseal lucency in the distal humerus on the lateral aspect , lateral view shows the proximal radius to be normally enlocated although the distal humeral epiphyses have not  yet ossified. The overall appearances suggest osteomyelitis of distal right humerus with associated septic arthritis.  Further investigation with ultrasound and probable MRI recommended. 



Overall, probable osteomyelitis of the distal right humerus with septic arthritis.  No evidence of recent or previous fracture.
