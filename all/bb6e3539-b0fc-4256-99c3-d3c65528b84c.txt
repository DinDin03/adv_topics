TELERADIOLOGY  REPORT - BENSON RADIOLOGY 


EXAMINATION: 


XR Knees Bilateral 


CLINICAL DETAILS: 


XRAY BILATERAL KNEES, XRAY RIGHT ANKLE 


Summary: 


?Previous injury at the distal tibia, with close proximity to the articular surface. MRI could be considered of the right ankle if felt clinically warranted. 


The changes within the medial compartments of the bilateral knees is slightly unusual for a 16 year old. Whilst there is no high grade degenerative or erosive arthropathy, the very mild amount of subchondral sclerosis is atypical. If there is concern regarding juvenile arthritis, paediatric rheumatology opinion could be considered. 


Clinical: 


Bilateral knee pain, and right ankle pain, tender medial tibial plateau. 


Findings: 


Xray Right Ankle: 


No acute fracture is identified. There is a small osteophytic abnormality of the tibial plateau appreciated, ?previous injury. No associated ankle joint fluid is demonstrated on xray, however given the young age of the patient and the proximity to the articular surface here, an MRI to assess the underlying articular cartilage of the tibiotalar articulation could be considered. 


Xray Bilateral Knee: 


Right Knee: 


No significant knee joint fluid. No significant erosive arthropathy. Very minor subchondral sclerosis is appreciated in the medial compartment, which is unusual in this age group. ?Any clinical concern regarding early juvenile arthritis. 


Left Knee: 


Similar findings to the opposite side, with preservation of the joint space, no evidence of fluid, however very minor subchondral sclerosis of the medial tibial plateau. No erosion. No fracture.
