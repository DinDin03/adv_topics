EXAMINATION: 



XRCHE - XR Chest 



XRARMWRI - XR Arm Whole Right 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Not using right arm since 24 - 36 hours?  Infection shoulder. 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



Lungs demonstrate peribronchial thickening in the inner thirds bilaterally.  This is suggestive of diffuse inflammation / infection.?  Aspiration.  There is no confluent focus of collapse or consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No pneumo mediastinum.  Cardiac transverse diameter is exaggerated by the AP projection.  It appears to be within normal limits.  No plethora oligaemia.  Hemidiaphragms are at normal levels.  12 pairs of ribs are seen.  Situs appears to be within normal limits.  There are no anomalies of segmentation / formation in the visualised vertebrae.  No pneumoperitoneum or pneumatosis to the extent imaged. 



There is evidence of reticulation at the muscle fat interface in relation to the right shoulder joint raising the possibility of an infection.?  Septic arthritis / early osteomyelitis noting that there is a lag between onset of symptoms and radiographic manifestations.  No bony or articular abnormality in the bones and joints of the right upper limb. No evidence of a fracture involving the clavicles.  The ribs are unremarkable.  Ultrasound of the right shoulder is recommended.
