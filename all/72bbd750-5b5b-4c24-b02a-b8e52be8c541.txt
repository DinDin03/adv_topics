-- Addended Report -- 



Significant prominence of the soft tissues anterior to the patella. Minor irregularity to the tibial physis without definite hypodensity. No hypodensity on the lateral. I note this patient is already an inpatient for left knee cellulitis. Short interval follow up study if very early Brodies is of concern.
