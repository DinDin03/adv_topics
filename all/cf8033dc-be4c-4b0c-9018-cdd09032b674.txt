EXAMINATION: 



XRPELV - XR Pelvis 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Left septic arthritis 2005.  Long term follow-up.  ? AVN. 



COMPARISON: 



Comparison is made with prior imaging of the XX/06/2010. 



FINDINGS: 



Alignment at both hip joints is anatomical.  There is subtle asymmetry in the size of the ossified femoral heads.  The left femoral head is slightly reduced in height measuring approximately 16.5 mm compared with 22 mm on the right.  The left femoral capital epiphysis is also slightly broader as is the femoral neck.  There is approximately 90% coverage of the left femoral head compared with complete coverage on the right.  The acetabular angles and shape of the acetabular fossae are relatively symmetrical.  The articular surfaces are otherwise smooth.  The joint spaces appear symmetrical.
