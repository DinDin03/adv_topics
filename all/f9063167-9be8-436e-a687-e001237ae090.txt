b'\nEXAMINATION: \n\n\nStudy: XR Pelvis \n\n\nProcedure(s): XRPELV - XR Pelvis \n\n\nCLINICAL DETAILS: \n\n\n1 day history sore leg.  Minimal weightbearing.  Antalgic gait.  Tender to circumduction. \n\n\nCOMPARISON: \n\n\nNone available at time of report \n\n\nFINDINGS: \n\n\nThere is moderate degree of periarticular osteopenia on the left.  The femur is held in mild flexion and this artificially produces loss of height of the femoral capital epiphysis.  The articular surfaces smooth and there is no evidence of Perthes disease.  There is widening of the left hip joint compartment consistent with hip joint effusion.  No definite lytic or sclerotic bony lesion identified.  Differential diagnosis could include irritable hip.  Septic arthritis would be best assessed with an ultrasound. \n\n\nREPORTED BY:  XX, Consultant, XX/05/2020 01:34 PM \n\n\n \n\n\n \n'
