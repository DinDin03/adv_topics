Prior images of the left hand from xx May xx/11/2016. 



FINDINGS: 



Alignment at the radio-carpal joints is anatomical and symmetrical.  The metacarpophalangeal joints are intact bilaterally.  There is soft tissue swelling at the proximal interphalangeal joint of the right index finger and mild soft tissue swelling at the distal interphalangeal joints of the right index and middle fingers.  There is significant soft tissue swelling at the distal interphalangeal joint of the left third finger.  There is premature fusion of the growth plate of the distal phalanx of the left middle finger and there is mild narrowing of the distal interphalangeal joint compartment.  Appearances here are highly suspicious of an inflammatory arthropathy.  No definite acute erosive changes are identified but narrowing of the distal interphalangeal joint is suspicious for cartilage loss.  No other acute bone abnormalities identified.  .
