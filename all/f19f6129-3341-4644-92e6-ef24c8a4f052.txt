CLINICAL DETAILS: 



17 yo with 6month history of widespread inflammatory arthritis predomiantely hands/feet/hips 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



Both hands: 



Bony alignment is unremarkable and there is no articular space narrowing or bony erosion apparent.  Carpal alignment is maintained and the ulnar styloid processes are intact. 



Both feet: 



Articular space is well preserved in the forefoot and midfoot regions.  No bony erosion or significant degenerative change is apparent on a plain radiographic basis.  Bony alignment appears unremarkable. 



No ankle joint effusion, plantar calcaneal spur or retrocalcaneal bursal effusion is apparent on either side. 



Pelvis and both sacroiliac joints: 



There is no significant sclerosis apparent in relation to either sacroiliac joint and the subchondral bone plates appear intact.  No sclerosis, erosion or fusion is seen to suggest sacroiliitis. 



Articular space in both hips is well preserved.  No bone erosion or articular space reduction is seen to suggest a synovial process.  Alignment of the hips is unremarkable.  No acute fracture or bone destruction is detected.
