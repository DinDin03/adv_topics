EXAMINATION: 


Study: XR Femur Left 


Procedure(s): XRFEMLE - XR Femur Left 


CLINICAL DETAILS: 


Unwitnessed fall at childcare.  Intermittent refusal of weightbear.  Tender over distal femur. 


COMPARISON: 


None available at time of report 


FINDINGS: 


On the lateral image, there is an area of focal lucency (key image). There is associated with increased density of the medial and lateral compartment of the knee joint. There is also a degree of prepatellar joint effusion. Together with clinical history and imaging findings, this may reflect an area of osteomyelitis with joint effusion or an isolated joint effusion. Septic arthritis needs consideration and correlation with an ultrasound maybe helpful. 


There is dense metaphyseal line of the distal femur and to a lesser extent on the proximal tibial but sparing of the proximal fibula. Whilst this could be normal variant bands, this could reflect growth arrest lines, chronic anaemia, bisphosphonate therapy and less likely lead poisoning. 


No acute fractures identified.  The right hip is enlocated.  The knee alignment is preserved. 


Findings have been conveyed to xx at  on the xx/4/2020.

-- Addended Report -- 


ADDENDUM: There is soft tissue swelling in the prepatellar region but no joint effusion. The lucency in the proximal tibial epiphysis is only seen on the lateral view and I wonder if this is artefact.  The appearance are non-specific at this stage and correlation with inflammatory markers would be helpful. Follow up clinically and with repeat xrays if there is ongoing concern is recommended. The metaphyses are felt to be normal. 


This report has been checked and verified correct by a Consultant.
