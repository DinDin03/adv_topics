COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



There is mild prominence of the soft tissues in the region of the metacarpophalangeal joints and distal interphalangeal joints of the digits.  Appearances here raise the possibility of soft tissue swelling.  There is normal tubulation of the long bones and no lytic or sclerotic bony lesions are identified.  There is mild degree of metaphyseal lucency in the region of the growth plates of the distal ulna bilaterally.  There is no definite features to suggest vitamin D related bone disease but in the absence of raised ANA,  it may be worthwhile checking vitamin D and vitamin C levels.
