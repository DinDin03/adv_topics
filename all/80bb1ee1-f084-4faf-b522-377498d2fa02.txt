EXAMINATION: 



XRFEMLE - XR Femur Left 



XRPELV - XR Pelvis 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



17-month-old female.  Pain and unable to weightbear with fever.  To exclude septic arthritis. 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



Pelvis: 



The femoral capital epiphyses are symmetrical.  There is good bony acetabular coverage bilaterally.  There is no evidence of acute fracture.  There are no changes to suggest presence of septic arthritis however a joint effusion is not excluded on plain film and there is ongoing clinical concern an ultrasound is recommended. 



There is faecal loading within the rectum. 



Left femur: 



There is no evidence of fracture.  There are no changes to suggest the presence of osteomyelitis although this can take 7-10 days to appear on plain film and if there is clinical concern a repeat XR at this time is recommended, conversely an MRI  could be performed sooner if there is a high level of concern.  There is no evidence of a knee joint effusion.
