EXAMINATION: 



XRHIPR - XR Hip Right 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



?  Septic arthritis versus irritable hip exclude fracture. Right hip 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



The right femoral capital epiphysis ossification is slightly delayed compared with the left. Adequate acetabular coverage.  Both hips are enlocated.  Subtle widening of the inferior joint space on the right compared with the left can be seen in effusion, however in this case I expect relates to slight patient rotation.  There are no erosions associated with the hip joints or elsewhere. 



Ultrasound can be considered to assess for the presence of a hip joint effusion if septic arthritis remains a clinical consideration.
