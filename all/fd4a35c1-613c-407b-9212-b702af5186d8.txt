b'\nEXAMINATION: \n\n\n\nStudy: XR Foot Left \n\n\n\nProcedure(s): XRFOOLE - XR Foot Left \n\n\n\nCLINICAL DETAILS: \n\n\n\n(L) fifth toe proximal phalanx OM.  Assess progress \n\n\n\nFINDINGS: \n\n\n\nThere is partial reformation of the head of the left fifth toes proximal phalanx with better bone definition / better definition of the previously destroyed margins, but the head of this phalanx  remains deformed.  Appearances are improved compared to XX/05/2018.  The epiphysis of the left fifth middle phalanx is not visible and the metaphyseal subchondral bone plate poorly defined.  The middle phalanx appears involved and the appearances suggest previous septic arthritis of the left fifth PIP joint.  (Assessment of the distance / interval between the head of the proximal phalanx / middle phalanx of this toe is difficult due to flexion but there is likely narrowing of the joint  epiphyseal/   middle phalanx diaphysis distance).  Ultrasound could be considered if concern of ongoing joint sepsis / effusion. \n\n\n\nREPORTED BY:  XX, Consultant, XX/08/2018 11:51 AM \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n'
