EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Spine Lumbosacral 



Procedure(s): XRSPLS - XR Spine Lumbosacral 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



15-year-old with acute on chronic hip / groin / lower back pain.  Family history of rheumatoid arthritis.  Elevated ESR.  ? ankylosing spondylitis. 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



There are 5 lumbar type vertebra.  Lumbar vertebral body and intervertebral disc heights are well maintained.  No spondylolisthesis.  No destructive bony lesions.  No lumbar vertebral features of ankylosing spondylitis. There is subtle blurring of the inferior aspect of the right sacroiliac joint, difficult to accurately qualify on non-dedicated projections and a significant volume of overlying bowel gas.  This is favoured to be artefactual, though if there is a high index of suspicion for sacroiliitis, dedicated SI joint views could be considered.
