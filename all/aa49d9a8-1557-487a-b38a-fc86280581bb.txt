There is cortical and subcortical irregularity demonstrated in the posterior aspect of both femoral condyles . the appearances are thought to represent ossification irregularity of the is difficult to completely exclude osteochondritis dissecans although this situated more posteriorly than expected for osteochondritis dissecans.  Follow-up x-ray may be warranted to further assess this.  MRI could be considered to further evaluate the appearance particularly if there any associated symptoms.  Ossification irregularity in the superior aspect of the patella is normal variant.  No specific features of established osteomyelitis or septic arthritis.  These however may be radiologically of comment .
