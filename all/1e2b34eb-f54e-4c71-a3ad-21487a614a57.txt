None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



Femoral capital epiphyses appear intact.  Normal articulation.  Joint space appears recent symmetric however does appear be some mild bulging of soft tissues around the right hip..  Normal enlocation on the frog lateral view. 



Patchy lucency seen in the proximal right femoral metadiaphysis laterally, not well seen on the frog lateral view. This is less well defined than expected for nutrient foramen.  Given the clinical context, focus of bony infection cannot be excluded and orthopaedic opinion is recommended.  No obvious periostitis.
