EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Knee Left 



Procedure(s): XRKNELE - XR Knee Left 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Medial femoral condyle OCD 



COMPARISON: 



Comparison is made with prior imaging of the XX/05/2018. 



FINDINGS: 



There has been significant deterioration in the appearances of the left knee when compared to the prior study.  There is an extremely large left knee joint effusion but that raises the possibility of haemarthrosis.  There has been an increase in sclerosis of the entire distal femoral epiphysis and the majority of the proximal tibial epiphysis.  Erosive changes are identified in both of the superolateral margin of the lateral femoral condyle and on all facets of the medial femoral condyle.  The history of previous surgery for osteochondral abnormality here is noted.  There has been an increase in narrowing of the medial joint compartment and there are erosive changes now also affecting the medial tibial plateau Appearances favour a synovial inflammatory process that is affecting both sides of the knee joint.  The differential could include rheumatoid arthritis or PV NS.  MR correlation is recommended.. 



I note the prior MRI examination of the right ankle in July 2016.  Similar changes of synovitis an erosive arthropathy were demonstrated then although not reported.  Correlation with the ESR and other inflammatory markers including rheumatoid factor is recommended for further investigation.,
