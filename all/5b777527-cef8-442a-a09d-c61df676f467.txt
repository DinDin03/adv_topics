EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Femur Right 



Procedure(s): XRFEMRI - XR Femur Right 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



7-year-old boy.  Right leg pain, limp, elevated inflammatory markers ? osteomyelitis 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



Both acetabulofemoral joints are enlocated.  There is satisfactory hip coverage.  The capital femoral epiphyses are normal in morphology.  The proximal femur is intact.  Distally, there is disruption of the articular surface of the distal femoral epiphysis, with some fragmentation seen anteriorly and erosive change extending into the epiphysis. There is a small joint effusion, with prominent soft tissue stranding seen within the posterior aspect of the knee joint. Findings most likely reflect osteomyelitis/septic arthritis. Although lesions such as a chondroblastoma can occur in a simlar area, the breach of the cortical surface is against this. An MRI is currently scheduled for this patient.
