EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Knees Bilateral 



Procedure(s): XRKNERI - XR Knee Right 



XRKNELE - XR Knee Left 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



New diagnosis  Wilson's disease.  Now on penicilliamine.  Bilateral knee pain without swelling.  ? Wilson's arthritis. 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



There is widening of the zone of provisional calcification in the region of the metaphyses of the distal femora and proximal tibia bilaterally.  The trabecular pattern of the remaining areas of bone appears slightly sclerotic.  There is minor irregularity of the articular surface of the left medial femoral condyle.  No other bony erosive changes are identified.  There is no evidence of knee joint effusion.  No acute bony abnormality identified. 



COMMENT: The appearances of the growth plates would be consistent with osteomalacia.  This is likely the sequelae of diffuse liver pathology and altered vitamin D metabolism as result of Wilson's disease.
