EXAMINATION: 



XRKNELE - XR Knee Left 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Septic arthritis. 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



The bony elements appear intact with no evidence of focal bony destruction.  Alignment is preserved.  Bulging of the soft tissues posteriorly may reflect some fluid within the knee joint and if there is any concern about there is an ultrasound suggested further assessment.  There is a further structure seen within the anterior soft tissues in the prepatellar region, which may reflect prepatellar bursitis and again sonographic assessment of this may be worthwhile.
