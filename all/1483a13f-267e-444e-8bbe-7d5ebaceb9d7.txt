There is mild widening of the medial aspect of the left hip joint and mild lateral positioning of the femoral head with the left acetabular fossa.  There is approximately 80% coverage of the femoral head and neck degree of coxa valga.  There is flattening of the left femoral head and mild modelling deformity consistent with the sequelae of past septic arthritis and DDH.  No acute lytic or sclerotic bony lesion is identified.  There is no soft tissue swelling.  The distal femur and knee joint appear normal.  There is no knee joint effusion. 



Comment:  No acute cause of hip pain identified.  Malalignment at the left hip joint may be responsible for pain.
