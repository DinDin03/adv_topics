EXAMINATION: 



XRSPC - XR Spine Cervical 



XRCHE - XR Chest 



XRPELV - XR Pelvis 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Struck compact during football.  Hyperextended neck.  Tender C-spine and lower to mid back.  Also saw left thigh. 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



Neck; 



Multiple surgical fusions are incidentally noted, these are C2 / C3 and C6 / C7.  There is also suspicion for a pars defect at C7 / T1.  Given these congenital effusions and if clinically concerned with ongoing neck pain.  CT or MRI may be required to further assess. 



Alignment is near anatomical.  There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling.  The atlantoaxial joint appears intact.  The dens is not clearly visualised. 



Thoracolumbar spine; 



Alignment is near anatomic.  There is slight scoliosis concave to the right centred in the mid thoracic region.  Vertebral body heights and disc spaces are maintained. 



Left leg; 



The knee and hip joints are unremarkable.  There is no fracture femur. 



 



 

-- Addended Report -- 



Fusion of the posterior elements of C2-C3 and anterior and posterior elements at C6-7 noted.  The C6 and C7 vertebral bodies are smaller and appearances could reflect the sequela of a juvenile arthritis or be congenital.  I agree that there is no evidence of acute injury within the limitations of plain film.  The odontoid view is suboptimal.
