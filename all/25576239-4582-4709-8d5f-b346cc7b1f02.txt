No lytic or sclerotic bony lesion identified. 



Right knee:  Bony alignment is anatomical and the articular surfaces smooth.  There is no knee joint effusion.  No lytic or sclerotic bony lesion identified.  No acute or healing injury.  No abnormal soft tissue mass or calcification.  The presence or absence of subtle cartilage erosion or internal derangement at the right knee is best assessed with MRI.
