b'\nEXAMINATION: \n\n\n\nStudy: US Foot Mid or Fore Left \n\n\n\nProcedure Items \n\n\n\nUSFOOLE - US Foot Mid or Fore Left \n\n\n\nXRFOOLE - XR Foot Left \n\n\n\nCLINICAL DETAILS: \n\n\n\nElite soccer player.  History of swelling around first MTP joint.  Please assess for any signs of synovitis, arthritis, tendonitis etc. \n\n\n\nNB   The referral stipulated right" but the LEFT foot was examined as this was the correct symptomatic side indicated by both patient and his mother. \n\n\n\nFindings: \n\n\n\nThis is the patients first imaging episode at this site or in this PAC system. \n\n\n\nReference is made to an external report for left foot ultrasound study XX/08/2017 (from Australian Radiology, Brighton): \n\n\n\nClinical history:   Pain plantar forefoot with exercise. \n\n\n\nFindings:    The patient localises most pain at the ball of the 1st MTP joint.  Scans of the foot with particular attention to this location show no evidence of 1st plantar plate tear or tenosynovitis.  No joint effusion.  The sesamoids appear bipartite medially but no evidence of acute sesamoiditis or sesamoid fracture is seen sonographically.  No neuroma-bursa between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal heads.  No adventitial bursitis. \n\n\n\nThere is mild synovial hypertrophy and fluid in the dorsum of the first MTP joint  which may indicate some mild inflammation.  Otherwise unremarkable. \n\n\n\nReported by Dr. Mark Tie \n\n\n\nX-RAY: \n\n\n\n(Standard 3 views = AP, oblique, lateral). \n\n\n\nPatient\'s age 15 years noted. \n\n\n\nOverall bone density and texture are normal throughout. \n\n\n\nThe bones and joints of the left foot are normal in appearance and alignment. \n\n\n\nNo evidence of a stress fracture/periosteal reaction, osteochondritis, avascular necrosis, tarsal coalition or chronic arthropathy. \n\n\n\nThe medial sesamoid is bipartite, a normal variant. \n\n\n\nIn the position as imaged, the longitudinal arch appears pronounced/high. \n\n\n\nULTRASOUND:    The examination concentrated upon the plantar aspect of the left medial forefoot. \n\n\n\nThe patient localises his symptoms (= episodic tenderness provoked by activity) to the medial portion of the ball of left foot.  The same symptoms predated the prior external ultrasound study. \n\n\n\nLeft first MTP joint appeared unremarkable.  No intra-articular fluid or synovial thickening is present. \n\n\n\nNo plantar plate tear shown. \n\n\n\nNo focal lesion or thickened bursa evident in the 1/2 intertarsal webspace. \n\n\n\nThe extensor hallucis longus tendon appeared normal and symmetric compared to the right side.  Along this tendons plantar surface is a short thin 2 mm hypoechoic layer with no associated hyperaemia.  A similar finding is demonstrated in the asymptomatic right side.  The possibility of a superficial adventitial bursa or perhaps localised tenosynovitis was considered, however, it was not tender to probe pressure and separate from the symptomatic site, therefore may not be clinically relevant. \n\n\n\nFocal tenderness was specifically elicited when pressure was applied directly over the medial sesamoid and replicated the patients symptoms.  This bone has an uneven contour, consistent with the bipartite appearance shown by preceding x-rays.  No surrounding hypoechoic rim of oedematous tissue or hyperaemia demonstrated to suggest inflammation but this does not rule out acute sesamoiditis or biomechanical irritation. \n\n\n\nConclusion: \n\n\n\nBipartite medial sesamoid with accompanying focal tenderness to probe pressure  due to acute sesamoiditis or biomechanical irritation?  This is better characterised by MRI, which is the preferred imaging modality in an elite athlete. \n\n\n\nPossible superficial adventitial bursa or localised tenosynovitis involving EHL but lack of accompanying tenderness at this site suggests it may not be clinically relevant.   Clinical correlation advised.  . \n\n\n\nSONOGRAPHER(s):\tROBYN DE NICHILO \n\n\n\nREPORTED BY:  XX, Consultant, XX/07/2018 06:33 PM \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n'
