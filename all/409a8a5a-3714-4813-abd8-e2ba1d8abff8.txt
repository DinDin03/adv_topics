b'\nEXAMINATION: \n\n\nStudy: XR Pelvis and Hip Left \n\n\nProcedure(s): XRHIPL - XR Hip Left \n\n\nXRPELV - XR Pelvis \n\n\nXRKNEEL - XR Knee Left \n\n\nCLINICAL DETAILS: \n\n\n6-year-old male limping 3 weeks.  No history trauma.  Complaining of left knee pain systemically well.  Differential Perthes versus septic arthritis. \n\n\nCOMPARISON: \n\n\nNone available at time of report \n\n\nFINDINGS: \n\n\nSlight rotation of the pelvis is appreciated however, allowing for this the acetabular angles appear within normal limits.  No evidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head.  Due to the slight rotation of the pelvis makes assessment for Kleins line difficult, although SUFE at this age would not be a typical presentation. No plain film evidence of a moderate to large hip joint effusion such as widening of the medial joint space or bowing of the surrounding soft tissue fat planes.  Normal appearance to the left knee joint. \n\n\nAn ultrasound could be considered to assess for a small joint effusion if there is clinical suspicion for differential cause of hip pain in a young male, such as transient synovitis \n\n\nREPORTED BY:  xx, Registrar, xx/06/2019 12:04 AM \n\n\nThis report was created by a Radiology Registrar and will be verified by a Radiology Consultant within 24 hours. \n\n\n \n\n-- Addended Report -- \n\n\nLeft knee: Normal alignment.
