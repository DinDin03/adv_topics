EXAMINATION: 



XRKNERI - XR Knee Right 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Infected mosquito bite with erythema and pain.  Sore on weight bearing.  Rule out joint infection and deep extension.. 



COMPARISON: 



. 



FINDINGS: 



There is the impression of some subcutaneous soft tissue swelling at the anterior medial aspect of the knee.  No bony abnormalities detected.  There is loss of clarity of the infrapatellar fat pad which may be due to superimposed soft tissue oedema in the subcutaneous tissues.  It is very difficult to completely exclude a small effusion although there is no significant distension of the suprapatellar pouch to indicate a large joint effusion.  The joint space does not appear to be significantly narrowed although given that a proportion  of the epiphyses remain cartilagenous  this can be difficult to assess accurately..  Septic arthritis and early osteomyelitis cannot be ruled out and  if there is ongoing clinical concern then ultrasound  and  follow-up x-ray could be considered.
