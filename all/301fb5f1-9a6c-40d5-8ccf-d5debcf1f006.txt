EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Pelvis 



Procedure(s): XRPELV - XR Pelvis 



XRLEGWRI - XR Leg Whole Right 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Limping right side, ongoing for 9 days?  Osteomyelitis?  Septic arthritis 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



A minimally displaced healing fracture is noted at the fibular diaphysis with mild periosteal reaction / callus formation noted. Presence of a lucent fracture line suggesting incomplete healing.  Minor surrounding soft tissue swelling. Correlation with history of trauma and point tenderness is suggested in the first instance. 



No definite trabecular matrix lucency or osseous destruction suggest established osteomyelitis.  Changes of osteomyelitis on x-ray can be subtle and late, if there is persisting clinical concern for osteomyelitis, radionuclide imaging or MRI can be considered 



Anatomical alignment between upper femoral appears active acetabuli.  No evidence of growth plate widening.  No abnormal epiphyseal lucency.
