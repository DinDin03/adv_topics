CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Comminuted fracture base MP. R/O metal. Check position. 



COMPARISON: 



XX/10/2016 



FINDINGS: 



There is narrowing of the joint space of the PIP joints of the right ring finger with mild ulnar deviation of the middle phalanx.  The articular surface is irregular, with prominent osteophytes seen dorsally. 



The rest of the joint spaces are preserved.  No new fractures are seen. 



The overall appearance suggests post-traumatic degenerative arthritis, though feasibly previous septic arthritis could have a similar appearance.
