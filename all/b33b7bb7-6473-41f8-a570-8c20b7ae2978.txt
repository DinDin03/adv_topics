EXAMINATION: 



XRPELV - XR Pelvis 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Post septic hip ? osteomyelitis 



COMPARISON: 



Made with study of xx/05/2014.  The femoral capital epiphyses are developing normally and joint spaces are reasonably symmetrical.  There are no focal areas of bone destruction or periosteal new bone formation to suggest  previous osteomyelitis.  No abnormality of either hip joint is detected.  There is good coverage of the femoral capital epiphyses bilaterally and acetabulae are normal. 



FINDINGS: 



As above.  Normal study with no evidence of any residual bony changes from previous septic arthritis and no evidence of ongoing or previous osteomyelitis.
