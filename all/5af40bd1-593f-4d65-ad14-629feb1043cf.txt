EXAMINATION: 


Study: XR Pelvis 


Procedure(s): XRPELV - XR Pelvis 


XRFEMLE - XR Femur Left 


XRANKLE - XR Ankle Left 


CLINICAL DETAILS: 


Painful and 1 week.  Previous chest x-ray showed osteopenic change. 


COMPARISON: 


XX/10/2020 


FINDINGS: 


There is persisting osteopenia in the left proximal femur there is no periosteal reaction or circumscribed lesion evident. Some mild osteopenia also demonstrated in the acetabulum. The hip demonstrates normal alignment. Note that the recent hip ultrasound XX/10/2020 do not demonstrate an effusion. 


The alignment about the hip knee and ankle is satisfactory.  There is a vague sclerotic line at the superior aspect of the tibial shaft and lower femoral shaft which is nonspecific.  No periosteal reaction circumscribed lesion is seen.  There is no soft tissue mass is identified. The periarticular osteopenia about the left hip is again noted but not quite as marked as on the previous study.  If there is any concern regarding infection or suspicious abnormality then MRI under fast feed and wrap could be  considered .Absence of an effusion would make septic arthritis or irritable hip unlikely.  No circumscribed lesion or evidence of buckle fracture.
