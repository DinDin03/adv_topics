No periosteal reaction is seen but there is diffuse soft tissue swelling.  in the feet there is impression of soft tissue swelling involving the left middle Hide but no established bony changes on either side is seen.  No destructive process elsewhere is seen.   No radiopaque foreign body is visible.  The pattern of involvement does not suggest synovitis but favours an aggressive bone process and in the first instance infection should be considered. \n\n\nThis addendum was created by  xxx Consultant, xx/10/2019 02:50 PM \n\n\nORIGINAL REPORT \n\n\nEXAMINATION: \n\n\nStudy: XR Hand Left \n\n\nProcedure(s): XRHANLE - XR Hand Left \n\n\nXRFOORI - XR Foot Right \n\n\nXRFOOLE - XR Foot Left \n\n\nCLINICAL DETAILS: \n\n\n9-year-old with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presenting with digit swelling in left index finger and middle toes (right and left) ? arthritic changes \n\n\nCOMPARISON: \n\n\nNone available at time of report \n\n\nFINDINGS: \n\n\nLeft hand: \n\n\nSoft tissue swelling of the second digit.

Taranath and Linke) with thanks.  There are additional erosions on asymptomatic toes including the proximal phalanx of the both 5th  toes and base of the proximal phalanx of the right big toe (latter only was seen on the oblique views). \n\n\nThis addendum was created by  xx Consultant, xx/10/2019 04:23 PM \n\n\nORIGINAL REPORT \n\n\nEXAMINATION: \n\n\nStudy: XR Hand Left \n\n\nProcedure(s): XRHANLE - XR Hand Left \n\n\nXRFOORI - XR Foot Right \n\n\nXRFOOLE - XR Foot Left \n\n\nCLINICAL DETAILS: \n\n\n9-year-old with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presenting with digit swelling in left index finger and middle toes (right and left) ? arthritic changes \n\n\nCOMPARISON: \n\n\nNone available at time of report \n\n\nFINDINGS: \n\n\nLeft hand: \n\n\nSoft tissue swelling of the second digit.
