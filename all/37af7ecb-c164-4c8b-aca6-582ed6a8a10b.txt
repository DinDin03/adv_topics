Irregular appearance of the two fibular edges is noted. No gross periosteal reaction, lytic lesion or focal osteopaenia. Osteomyelitis cannot be excluded and prior imaging is required for comparison (the ED clinicians are aware and attaining the images currently). \n\n\n\nNo ankle joint effusion. \n\n\n\nThe lateral malleolus is intact.
