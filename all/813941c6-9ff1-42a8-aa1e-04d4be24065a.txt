EXAMINATION: 



XRCHE - XR Chest 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Urticaria, arthritis, febrile, lymphadenopathy. 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



There is a globular appearance to the heart, with no specific chamber enlargement identified. Although the cardiothoracic ratio on the frontal projection is within normal limits, there is the appearance of some fullness of the heart on the lateral projection. Given these appearances, a pericardial effusion needs consideration, and could be further assessed with an echocardiogram. 



The lungs are clear, no confluent air space opacity seen.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No features of pulmonary oedema.  Left-sided aortic arch, cardiac apex and gastric bubble.  The bony elements appear unremarkable.
