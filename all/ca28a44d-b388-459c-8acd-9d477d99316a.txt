Study: XR Pelvis 


Procedure(s): XRPELV - XR Pelvis 


CLINICAL DETAILS: 


Follow up of septic arthritis of right hip with dislocation 


COMPARISON: 


Prior imaging XX/07/2020 and  XX/07/2020 


FINDINGS: 


The right and left hips demonstrate satisfactory alignment.  The acetabular angles are normal.  There is some heterogeneity and irregularity of the ossification centre of the right femoral head. The femoral metaphysis shows mild relative osteopenia but otherwise is forming normally.  Bilateral periosteal reactions along the femoral shafts are again noted most likely physiologic.
