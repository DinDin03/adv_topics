FINDINGS: 



There is some soft tissue swelling particular around the base of the second toe.  The underlying bones are intact, with no bone destruction or periosteal new bone formation to suggest osteomyelitis.  The joint spaces are well preserved.  Early signs of osteomyelitis may be missed on plain radiography and if there is ongoing concern then alternate imaging may be required.
