EXAMINATION: 



XRPELV - XR Pelvis 



XRFEMRI - XR Femur Right 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Right hip pain, refused to weightbear, tender greater trochanter?  Septic arthritis?  Lesion?  Fracture 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



There is a subtle asymmetry of the medial hip joint space, wider on the right, unsure if this may represent small right hip effusion or if it is rotational.  Both femurs and epiphysis are symmetrical, no focal lesion or fracture.  Bony pelvis within normal limits. 



CONCLUSION: 



No abnormality detected on radiograph however, further workup / imaging would depend on the level of clinical concern
