EXAMINATION: 



XRKNELE - XR Knee Left 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Left knee cellulitis ?  Follow. 



COMPARISON: 



Right knee XX/09/2016 



FINDINGS: 



There no features to suggest significant joint effusion when comparison is made with the non-symptomatic right knee.  The alignment is within normal limits.  No bony abnormality detected. 



Early osteomyelitis or septic arthritis may not be clearly visible on x-ray.  If there is strong clinical concern then ultrasound  is more sensitive for evaluating  knee effusion.  Follow-up x-ray, bone scan or MRI may be considered depending on the clinical situation.
