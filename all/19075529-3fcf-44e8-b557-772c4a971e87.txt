EXAMINATION: 



Study: US Ankle Hindfoot Left 



Procedure(s): USANKLE - US Ankle Hindfoot Left 



XRANKLE - XR Ankle Left 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Puncture wound with a metal gardening tool 2 days ago.  Not weightbearing.  Assess for septic arthritis. 



Findings: 



Ultrasound of left ankle: 



No ankle joint effusion. 



Scanning over the puncture wound indicated a hypoechoic cleft of oedema extending deeply within the subcutaneous tissues and adjacent to a venous structure, likely a tributary of the long saphenous vein.  Adjacent to the vein there are several small echogenic foci which suggest areas of debris (foreign bodies).  Associated hyperaemia is present within the oedematous subcutaneous soft tissues. 



Left ankle (self determined): 



Soft tissue swelling is noted overlying the medial malleolus.  Adjacent to this region there are a number of small radiodense foci which are compatible with the noted echogenic regions on ultrasound.  Appearances suggest this represents a little nonspecific debris likely arising from the tool that caused the puncture wound. No evidence of gas within the soft tissues. 



Conclusion: 



Debris within the deep subcutaneous tissues adjacent to a venous structure and appearances are consistent with small foreign bodies.  No evidence to suggest a joint effusion / septic arthritis.
