EXAMINATION: 



XRFOORI - XR Foot Right 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



The radiographs do not show any sign of displaced or angulated fracture or periosteal reaction.  I cannot see any acute fracture or focal soft tissue swelling.  Further clinical correlation is required with site of maximum symptoms, which is not described in the clinical information.  Normal alignment.  I note the history of juvenile arthritis however no erosive or other inflammatory arthropathy changes are demonstrated..
