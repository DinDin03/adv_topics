EXAMINATION: 



XRPELV - XR Pelvis 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Previous septic right hip.  Limp with external rotation. 



COMPARISON: 



Made with the previous plain radiographs of September 2015 



FINDINGS: 



The right femoral capital epiphysis is smaller than normal and mildly irregular.  There is residual osteopenia of the right proximal femur with an area of lucency in the medial femoral metaphysis and there is widening of the right hip joint space raising possibility of residual right hip joint effusion.  Osteopenia is also present in the ischium at the site of presumed osteomyelitis and septic arthritis noted in the study of 2015..  Reactivation of the right hip septic arthritis or possible synovitis cannot be excluded and further ultrasound study is suggested.  The small irregular right femoral capital epiphysis also suggests possible avascular necrosis..  Orthopaedic follow-up recommended.
