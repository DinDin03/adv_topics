Study: XR Hand Wrist Forearm Left 


Procedure(s): XRHWRIFORLE - XR Hand Wrist Forearm Left 


XRCHE - XR Chest 


XRSPLS - XR Spine Lumbosacral 


XRSPC - XR Spine Cervical 


XRHANRI - XR Hand Right 


CLINICAL DETAILS: 


Relevant Clinical Indications / Comments: trauma - fall from mountain bike. hit head. swollen left wrist, cuts to right hand, pain L3-4 


Admit Reason: SINGLE TRAUMA - BLUNT INJURY, Admit Date Time: 2020-09-xx 14:21 


COMPARISON: 


None available at time of report 


FINDINGS: 


XR left wrist and forearm.: 


Applied dressing reduces sensitivity of radiograph for fine bony details. 


There is mildly comminuted fracture involving the distal metaphyses of the left radius, with ventral displacement and angulation of the distal fracture fragment. Distraction of approximately 5 mm between the fracture fragments is seen.  Lateral alignment is preserved.  Extension to the growth plate though suspected but cannot be clearly appreciated. Significant soft tissue swelling along around the left traced noted as well. 


No accompanying fracture of the distal ulna.  No displaced fracture of carpal bones or other bones of the hand. Distal left radioulnar joint appear to be intact. 


XR right hand: 


No displaced fracture in the visualised bones.  All joints of hand are enlocated.  Right distal radioulnar joint and radio-carpal alignment are intact. 


Chest X-ray: 


Lungs and pleural recesses are clear.  No pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum or subdiaphragmatic free gas.  Cardiomediastinal outlines are within normal limits.  No displaced fracture in the visualised bones. 


There is bilateral widening of the AC joint space, likely due to revision of the lateral end of the clavicles.  No destructive osseous lesion is noted locally. Such bilaterally symmetrical erosion of the lateral end of the clavicle can be associated with rheumatoid arthritis or scleroderma or less likely due to hyper parathyroidism because I do not see any abnormal bone density or sub periosteal erosive change elsewhere, clinico pathological correlation and comparison with previous radiographs will be helpful. 


XR cervical spine: 


Vertebral alignment and curvature is well preserved.  So are the vertebral heights and disc spaces.  Facet joints are enlocated.  No displaced fractures of the spinous processes.  Intact cranio cervical and cervico thoracic junction.  No abnormal prevertebral soft tissue swelling is noted either.  No displaced fracture in the mandible. 


Mild asymmetrical widening of the atlanto dens interval on the right side is likely due to rotation. No displaced fracture in the odontoid peg. 


Note is made up of bifid spinous process of the C5 vertebra. 


X R Lumbosacral Spine: 


Vertebral alignment and curvature is fairly preserved.  Vertebral heights and disc spaces are intact.  No obvious pars articular fracture or facet dislocation.  Pedicles, spinous processes as well as transverse processes are intact.  Psoas outlines are well visualised.  Both SI joints appear normal. Hip joints are enlocated.

-- Addended Report -- 


Substantive agreement with the report. There is a transitional vertebra at S1 a normal variant. Very minimal anterior wedging of the T12 vertebral body, correlate with focal tenderness.  Results discussed with Surgical RMO Tom on xx/09/2020 at 12:30.
