EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Pelvis 



Procedure(s): XRPELV - XR Pelvis 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



5-year-old female left hip pain with difficulty walking since yesterday afternoon. 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



There is no evidence of DDH or SCFE.  No acute fracture or dislocation identified. 



There is however bulging of the fat pad surrounding the left proximal femur with subtly widened left hip joint space medially (7 vs 5mm) and overall findings are suspicious for an underlying left hip joint effusion.  Entities such as transient synovitis and septic arthritis of the left hip joint require consideration. USS could be performed to further evaluate. 



No cortical breach or bony destruction seen.  Visualised bowel gas pattern is unremarkable.
