EXAMINATION: 



Study: US Hip Paediatric Left 



Procedure(s): USHIPPLE - US Hip Paediatric Left 



XRKNEEL - XR Knee Left 



XRPELV - XR Pelvis 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



5-year-old boy.  Left groin pain unable to weightbear. 



Findings: 



X-ray pelvis: 



Both hip joints are enlocated.  No fracture identified.  The proximal femoral epiphyses are normal.  There is no evidence of osteomyelitis.  Mild rectal faecal loading is noted. 



Left knee: 



No fracture or dislocation.  No knee joint effusion.  Early ossification of the patella is noted.  No bony lesion.  Subtle subcutaneous oedema anterior to the patellar tendon is noted. 



Ultrasound bilateral hips: 



There is a moderate left hip effusion that appears anechoic and simple.  The synovium is slightly thickened.  The overlying iliopsoas is unremarkable. 



No right hip joint effusion. 



Conclusion: 



A moderate simple left hip joint effusion is demonstrated and the left proximal femur has a normal radiographic appearance. Differentials would include transient synovitis and septic arthritis of the left hip. Clarification with clinical findings and inflammatory markers is recommended.
