-- Addended Report -- 



The soft tissue swelling in the vicinity of the right knee joint and distal femur is more marked than previously and there is loss alignment at the knee joint between the distal femur and proximal tibia.  The appearance suggests probable large knee joint effusion.  There is metaphysis lucency in the proximal tibia but no frank bone destruction or periosteal new bone is seen.  There is increased density in relation the suprapatellar pouch at the upper end of the marked soft tissue swelling.  The appearances raise the possibility of septic arthritis involving the right knee and further follow-up with knee sonography is recommended for further evaluation.
