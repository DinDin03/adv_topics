EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Knee Right 



Procedure(s): XRKNELE - XR Knee Left 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Tripped and fell on the left knee.  Past history of rheumatoid arthritis. 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



The bones are mildly gracile and osteopenic.  There is flaring of the metaphyses that can be a feature of inflammatory arthropathy.  Bony alignment is anatomical.  The articular surfaces are smooth.  There is a large knee joint effusion.  There is irregularity of the tibial spines with a small bony fragment identified centrally within the knee joint.  Appearances raise the possibility of cruciate ligament disruption.  MR could confirm damage to the internal structures.  No other definite acute fracture identified.
