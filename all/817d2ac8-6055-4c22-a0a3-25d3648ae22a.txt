EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Knee Left 



Procedure(s): XRKNELE - XR Knee Left 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



? osteomyelitis or septic arthritis.  On prolonged antibiotics.  Increased swelling left knee. 



COMPARISON: 



Prior imaging of the xx/09/2018. 



FINDINGS: 



There is soft tissue swelling surrounding the knee joint.  There is significant osteopenia.  The AP projection is held in flexion and oblique making interpretation difficult.  A lucency identified in the medial aspect of the left femur is thought to represent part of the growth plate given the projection.  There is no evidence of acute periosteal new bone formation and there is no significant knee joint effusion.  The presence or absence of underlying osteomyelitis may be best assessed with a repeat MRI study if there is ongoing clinical concern.
