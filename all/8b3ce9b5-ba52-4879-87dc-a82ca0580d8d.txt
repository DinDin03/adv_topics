FINDINGS: 



A right IJ cc has been removed.  An ETT an NG tube remain in place. 



Cardiothymic contours are stable. 



The ground-glass changes throughout the lung fields are stable.  There has been interval volume loss within the right upper lobe. 



The patient is noted to be rotated to the right which gives the impression of prominence of the left shoulder soft tissues.  The left shoulder remains enlocated.  There is no bony changes to suggest the presence of osteomyelitis.  An ultrasound would be of use to determine if there is a shoulder joint effusion. 



 



 

-- Addended Report -- 



Soft tissue swelling is noted relation to the left shoulder joint with joint space widening..  Septic arthritis would appear to be likely aetiology for the appearances and ultrasound is recommended.  The absence of bony changes of osteomyelitis would not exclude this diagnosis at this stage..  In the lungs there is now consolidation in the left lower lobe partially obscuring the left hemidiaphragm  in addition  to the opacity in the right upper lobe and bilateral interstitial changes.
