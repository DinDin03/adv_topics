EXAMINATION: 


Study: XR Knee Right 


Procedure(s): XRKNEER - XR Knee Right 


CLINICAL DETAILS: 


1-year-old. Fever for 2 days, unwilling to weight bear.  ? effusion right knee 


COMPARISON: 


None available at time of report 


FINDINGS: 


No fracture.  Subtle linear lucency along the proximal tibia demonstrated on the anterior projection is favoured to be trabecular marking rather than a fracture. 


Knee appears to be slightly flexed, but joint alignment is otherwise normal. 


There is a large knee joint effusion. No lipohaemarthrosis. 


No bone erosion. 


I note from the treating clinician that there is no preceding history of trauma. In this context, septic arthritis and transient synovitis require consideration (depending on clinical findings and biochemical markers).
