FINDINGS: 


There is sclerosis and modelling deformity of the proximal shaft of the right femur and the humeral neck.  There is also flattening and modelling deformity of the humeral head.  Transverse lucency in the region of the proximal humeral shaft is thought to in part represent widening of the normal undulating growth plate of the humeral neck.  There is a degree of varus angulation here.  The humeral head is enlocated within the glenoid fossa.  No acute bony abnormality identified.  There is broadening of the metaphyseal region of the distal humerus.  The radial head is enlocated.  No abnormal soft tissue mass identified.
