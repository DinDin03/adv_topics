EXAMINATION: 


Study: XR Pelvis 


Procedure(s): XRPELV - XR Pelvis 


CLINICAL DETAILS: 


Follow up left hip septic arthritis 


COMPARISON: 


Prior imaging of the XX/09/2019. 


FINDINGS: 


Since the prior examination there has been an increase in sclerosis of the left femoral head.  There is also flattening of the femoral head and associated widening of the left hip joint compartment.  This results in approximately 80% coverage of the femoral head.  There are ill-defined lucencies in the sub metaphyseal region.  Appearances are consistent with a degree of avascular necrosis following known septic arthritis.  The articular surface of the femoral head is irregular.  The right hip appears normal
