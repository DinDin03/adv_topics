There is significant soft tissue swelling around the wrist joint, both dorsal and ventral to the carpal bones which has progressed since the prior study.  The underlying bones of the wrist and metacarpals are unremarkable, with no erosive changes and no focal bony abnormalities.  There is no evidence of acute or subacute fracture. In the absence of clinical infection, inflammatory arthritis is  likely. Ultrasound or MRI may be helpful to compartmentalise the soft tissue changes.
