EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Elbow Left 



Procedure(s): XRELBLE - XR Elbow Left 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Known J I A.  Symptoms of locking and clinically decreased range of movement in flexion.  ? JIA ? mechanical. 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



There is a small elbow joint effusion.  There is normal alignment.  On the lateral view there is  irregular lobulated lucency projected over the olecranon fossa which appears to lie on the lateral aspect on the AP.  This is associated with nmarrowing of the joint space. The radial head, and humeral articular surfaces are appear reasonable. There are no loose bony fragments identified within the joint space.  Appearances could be secondary to juvenile arthritis of the elbow joint, and MRI is recommended for further evaluation.
