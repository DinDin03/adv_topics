EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Knee Left 



Procedure(s): XRKNELE - XR Knee Left 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Septic arthritis ? evidence of osteomyelitis. 



COMPARISON: 



Comparison is made with prior imaging of the XX/12/2016. 



FINDINGS: 



There is ill-defined lucency and sclerosis throughout the metaphysis and extending into the distal shaft of the left femur.  Appearances are in keeping with bony infection.  The previously described fibrous cortical defect is still presen. There is significant cortical thickening on the posterior and medial aspect of the distal shaft of the left femur.  There is no knee joint effusion.  There is also evidence of ill-defined lucency and sclerosis involving the proximal left fibula.  This has evolved over series, there is subacute periosteal new bone formation surrounding the proximal shaft of the left fibula.  Appearances here are also consistent with osteomyelitis.  I note that this area was hot on previous bone scan.  The given the 2 foci of osteomyelitis, the possibility of CRMO is raised.  Correlation with blood culture recommended.  .
