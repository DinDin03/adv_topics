EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Ankle Right 



Procedure(s): XRANKRI - XR Ankle Right 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Ankle swelling onset over past 4 days.  Fever with pain and swelling lateral malleolus:  ?  Septic arthritis 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



There is no sizable ankle joint effusion. 



No focal periosteal reaction/ cortical breach/ focal osteopenia is present to suggest established osteomyelitis (noting that x-ray findings of OM occur late in the clinical course). 



Irregularity at the tip of the fibula suggests a prior avulsion injury at this site.  A 2 x 1 mm osseous fleck adjacent the medial malleolus might also reflect old trauma. 



Alignment remains anatomic.  No fracture identified.

-- Addended Report -- 



Well corticated focus of calcification adjacent to the medial malleolus is consistent with a developmental variant.  There is mild soft tissue swelling anterior to the ankle joint but no large ankle joint effusion.
