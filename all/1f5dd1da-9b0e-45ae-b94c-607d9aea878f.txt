XRCHE - XR Chest 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



No clinical details available. Known history of irritable hip and septic arthritis. 



COMPARISON: 



Prior imaging of the xx/09/2015. 



FINDINGS: 



The distal tip of the PICC catheter is identified in the region of the distal SVC.  The heart size is generous but within normal limits.  There is an increase in peribronchial interstitial opacity throughout the lung fields extending into the upper lower zones.  The possibility of mild viral lower respiratory tract infection is raised.  The peripheral lung fields and pleural reflections are otherwise clear.
