EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Knees Bilateral 



Procedure(s): XRKNEER - XR Knee Right 



XRKNEEL - XR Knee Left 



XRFINLE - XR Finger Left 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



10-year-old female 2-day history fever.  Bilateral ?knee? pain and swelling.  Non-weight bearing.  Also injured third finger.  Swelling and pain proximal phalanx.  ? bony injury. 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



Right knee: 



There is a moderate knee joint effusion.  No periosteal reaction or bony lucency is seen. There is a subtle irregular cortical contour of the deep surface of the patella. This is non-specific, and could be technical, however in the context of a chronic inflammatory arthropathy could reflect remodelling erosive change. No fractures are seen. 



Left knee: 



There is a moderate knee joint effusion.  No periosteal reaction or bony lucency is seen. No erosions are identified.  No fractures are seen. 



Left finger: 



There is oedema involving the soft tissues of the radial margin of the left middle finger which is most pronounced adjacent the proximal and middle phalanx.  No erosion, fractures or periosteal reaction is seen. 



Impression: 



Given the bilaterallity, an inflammatory arthropathy should be considered. A multifocal viral arthritis is a differential. This requires further clinical correlation.
