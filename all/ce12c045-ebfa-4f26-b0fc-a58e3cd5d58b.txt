EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Ankle Left 



Procedure(s): XRANKLE - XR Ankle Left 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



1-year-old male. Swollen ankle. Not weightbearing. Fracture? 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



Moderate size joint effusion and adjacent fat stranding. No gross bony destruction or periosteal reaction to suggest osteomyelitis. No discrete fracture identified. Anatomic alignment is preserved. 



Findings raise the possibility of septic arthritis. Ultrasound to confirm the presence of effusion +/- diagnostic aspirate may be of utility if there is any clinical concern for septic arthritis.

-- Addended Report -- 



Significant portion of the density in the ankle likely reflects cartilage. I agree ultrasound may be performed to further assess.
