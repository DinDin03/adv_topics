EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Knee Right 



Procedure(s): XRKNERI - XR Knee Right 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



1-day history of painful right knee.  Tender above the patella anteriorly and possible knee effusion clinically?  Evidence of effusion?  Osteomyelitis?  Septic arthritis 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



The bones appear unremarkable.  No definite evidence of fracture.  No periosteal reaction. Small amount of fluid in the suprapatellar pouch suspected.  Correlation with ultrasound recommended. There is minor irregularity of the metaphyseal surface on the lateral view of the femur, which may be within normal limits. If there is concern regarding osteomyelitis then an MRI could be considered. A follow-up x-ray in the short term may be of benefit to ensure stability, otherwise correlating with the contralateral leg to assess for symmetry in the context of normal variation may be helpful.
