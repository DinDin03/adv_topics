b'\nEXAMINATION: \n\n\nStudy: XR Knee Right \n\n\nProcedure(s): XRKNEER - XR Knee Right \n\n\nXRHIPR - XR Hip Right \n\n\nCLINICAL DETAILS: \n\n\nLimp for past 1 week.  Previous ankle x-ray NAD.  Unable to walk.  Tender knee and hip.  No trauma. \n\n\n? Perthes ? fracture. \n\n\nCOMPARISON: \n\n\nNone available at time of report \n\n\nFINDINGS: \n\n\nPelvis and right hip \n\n\nThe pelvic ring is intact.  Symmetric appearances at both hips, with adequate femoral head coverage.   No evidence of established Perthes disease.  The inter-gluteal fat planes appear preserved. \n\n\nNo erosions or periostitis.  The right hip is enlocated.  No fracture visualised. \n\n\nRight knee \n\n\nThere is a very large knee joint effusion, with distension of the suprapatellar pouch. Allowing for the normal irregularity of the distal femoral epiphysis, a slightly shaggy margin is suspicious for periostitis. There are patchy lucencies at the lateral femoral metaphysis, which is suspicious for early erosion. No convincing Brodies abscess. \n\n\nSeptic arthritis is difficult to exclude, and requires clinical correlation. Orthopaedic review recommended. \n\n\nNo fracture or malalignment. \n\n\nREPORTED BY:  XX Registrar, XX/06/2019 11:31 AM \n\n\n \n\n\n \n'
