-- Addended Report -- 



Reduction of the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint space is identified in association with erosive changes along the base of the proximal phalanx and lateral aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal.  Associated soft tissue swelling is identified. I agree that appearances favour infective aetiology.

ORIGINAL REPORT 



EXAMINATION: 



XRFOOLE - XR Foot Left 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



12-month-old injury ? painful of fracture 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



There is loss of joint space and periarticular erosions seen around the left D5 metatarsophalangeal joint.  The appearances may reflect those of an old septic arthritis. Given the normal appearances of the other joints of the foot, an inflammatory arthropathy is felt less likely. No fracture identified.
