TELERADIOLOGY  REPORT - EVERLIGHT RADIOLOGY 



EXAMINATION: 



XR Pelvis 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



X-RAY PELVIS AND BILATERAL HIPS 



CLINICAL NOTES: 



Persistent right-sided hip and iliac crest pain. Discomfort is more than one week. 



FINDINGS: 



There is appropriate positioning of both hip joints. The femoral epiphyses appear normal. There is no evidence of collapse or avascular necrosis of the femoral head. 



No definite abnormality is seen within the pelvis. Both iliac crests are partially obscured from view by overlying bowel gas and faecal matter but allowing for this I can see no underlying bone abnormalities. 



There is no widening of the sacroiliac joints or symphysis pubis. 



Please correlate clinically and consider further investigation depending on the clinical concern. 



Osteomyelitis or septic arthritis cannot be excluded with x-ray.
