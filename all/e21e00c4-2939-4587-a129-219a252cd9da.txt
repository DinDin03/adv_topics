-- Addended Report -- 


There is the impression of an ankle joint effusion, with increased density in the posterior ankle joint, and slight bulging of the anterior soft tissues.  This should be correlated with ultrasound.  There is also mild soft tissue swelling over the medial malleolus. I agree there are no features of established osteomyelitis. 


Findings conveyed to the Orthopaedics registrar Dr.XX at 1819.
