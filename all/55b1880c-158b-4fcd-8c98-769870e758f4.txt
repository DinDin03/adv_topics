EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Elbow Right 



Procedure(s): XRELBRI - XR Elbow Right 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Swollen right elbow noticed by GP. ? septic arthritis. 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



Bony alignment is preserved with no fracture. 



Allowing for rotation, there is no significant elevation of the anterior or posterior fat pad to suggest elbow joint effusion. 



If there is ongoing concern for septic arthritis, ultrasound may be of utility in assessing for effusion.

-- Addended Report -- 



There is evidence of stranding involving the fat in the distal arm and proximal forearm on the right side resulting in lack of a clear interface between the subcutaneous fat and the muscular rod plane.  This suggests the presence of a infection / inflammation. Exclusion of septic arthritis is warranted. An ultrasound of the right elbow joint is strongly recommended.  I note that an ultrasound has been subsequently performed.
