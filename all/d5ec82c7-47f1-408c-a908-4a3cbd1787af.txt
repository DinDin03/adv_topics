EXAMINATION: 


Study: XR Tibia Fibula Right 


Procedure(s): XRTIBRI - XR Tibia Fibula Right 


CLINICAL DETAILS: 


Septic arthritis right knee and osteomyelitis- assess progress 


COMPARISON: 


None available at time of report 


FINDINGS: 


Multiple surgical clips is seen around the medial aspect of the right knee, proximal medial calf.  There is extensive soft tissue swelling around the right knee joint space and medial joint line which may represent synovitis and/or fluid. 


This appears more prominent than on previous examination of XX/01/2020. 


In addition there is marked abnormality of the proximal mid tibia, with lucent and permeative appearance to mid tibial shaft, and periosteal reaction medially. 


There may be small involucrum at the mid tibia medially posteriorly.  (In the absence of any recent surgical intervention). 


Further density seen in the proximal intraosseous space on the oblique AP view, although this may be artifactual related to overlying dressings. 


There is demineralisation at the mid to distal tibia and fibula.  There is irregular suspected erosive change at the posterior distal femoral metaphysis which is new since the previous examination, and possibly represents bony changes of osteomyelitis also. 


MRI assessment could be considered although there will be susceptible artefact related to the overlying surgical clips.
