EXAMINATION: 



Study: XR Pelvis 



Procedure(s): XRFINLE - XR Finger Left 



XRPELV - XR Pelvis 



CLINICAL DETAILS: 



Known enthesitis related arthritis.  Exclude sacroiliitis.  Fracture left little finger. 



COMPARISON: 



None available at time of report 



FINDINGS: 



Left little finger:  There is no evidence of acute fracture with normal alignment.  I cannot identify any periosteal new bone or sclerosis to confirm a subacute fracture.  Correlation with recent imaging would be helpful. 



Pelvis: the sacroiliac joints are preserved and the bony articular surfaces are reasonably well preserved on the oblique views.  There is no evidence of sclerosis or significant bone destruction or new bone formation.
